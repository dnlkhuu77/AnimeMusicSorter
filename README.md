# AnimeMusicSorter

This is a Java application utliziting Maven and the [MP3agic library](https://github.com/mpatric/mp3agic).

This application will organize anime MP3 files (ripped and downloaded from CDs) according to the song's length and whether it's an OP/ED. This is intended for easy organizing when imported to iTunes or Spotify's local song lists.

Some example music to test with is available on [my website](dnlkhuu77.github.io).
